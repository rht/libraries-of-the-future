CHAPTER SEVEN
A Measure of the Effectiveness of
Information-Retrieval Systems
To SOME INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS, a particularly simple schema is appropriate. The system is a "black
box" that contains a collection or set of items and that, from time to time, either spontaneously or in response to a request, offers a subset of its contents to one of its sub-
scribers and withholds the complementary subset. An
Aitem may be thought of as a document. subscriber may
be thought of as simply a criterion: to the subscriber, an item is either pertinent or not pertinent. If one considers
--a single item of the collection and focuses his attention
upon a particular occasion a particular request from
--a subscriber or a particular spontaneous offering by the
system he sees that the performance of the system may be described simply by placing a tally mark in a two-by-
two contingency table: 148

was advantage taken of the fact that evaluative pro-

cedures have been developed for, and found useful in,

other fields of application (e.g., radar, sonar, psycho-
physics) in which performance may be summarized in

two-by-two contingency tables. Swets therefore adapted

some of the apparatus of statistical decision theory to the information-retrieval context and proposed a measure of

merit, a measure that quantifies the abiUty of the system

to maximize the expected value ("payoff") of a retrieval

trial, i.e., of an offering or withholding of an individual

item on a particular occasion. The measure takes into

account the relative frequency and the utility (value

minus cost) of each of the four categories in the two-by-

Wetwo table.

shall not review here Swets's explanation

of its derivation. Let it suffice to say that an assumption

of normality of distribution is involved, that the measure

is based on maximum-likelihood statistics, and that, given

the relative frequencies of hits and false drops in a par-

ticular sample, one can read the value of the measure

from an available table or graph.

The measure is simple, convenient, and appropriate. It

gives definite meaning to the concept, the "basic discriminating power" of an information-retrieval system. The measure clearly separates discriminating power from mere
willingness to yield output, thus avoiding a confusion that has been rife these last several years and that ap-
pears to be at the root of many informational difficulties.
Moreover, the measure brings with it a well-developed system of procedures that facilitate analysis and interpre-

tation of data.
We expect Swets's measure to prove useful in evalua-
tion of information systems. The main obstacle may lie

in determination of the pertinence of withheld items. That obstacle is wide. It causes trouble for all the approaches to evaluation of performance in retrieval of information from large collections.
