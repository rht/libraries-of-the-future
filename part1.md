##MAN'S INTERACTION WITH RECORDED KNOWLEDGE

Our examination of concepts and problems in the domain of procognitive systems dealt with four topics:
1. Information measures of the world's store of knowledge.
2. Aims, requirements, criteria, and plans for procognitive systems.
3. Schemata for storage, organization, retrieval, and dissemination of information.
4. Man-computer interaction in procognitive systems. The main lines of study, and the projections and conclusions to which they led, are set forth in the following chapters.
